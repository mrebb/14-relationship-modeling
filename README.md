## /api/v1/employees and /api/v1/skills

* POST request: passes data as stringifed JSON in the body of a post request to create a new resource
* GET request : /api/v1/employees/:id  passes the id of a resource through the url endpoint to get a resource. this uses req.params.
* PUT request: passes data as stringifed JSON in the body of a put request to overwrite a pre-existing resource
* DELETE request: passes the id of a resource though the url endpoint to delete a resource using req.params

* Handles GET, POST, PUT, DELETE methods for any model that is added to existing models directory
* GET handles 'api/v1/employees' when queryString has valid or empty ID
